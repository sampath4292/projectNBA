        Based on the analysis of data from over 10,000 sample cases, we have
        generated the following predictions and precautions for you. These
        insights are derived from patterns observed in individuals with similar
        health histories and blood groups.

        The results of this project are based on available data and statistical
        models. While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, it is important
        to note that predictive models in healthcare are continuously evolving
        and subject to limitations, including data quality and sample size.
        Consultation with healthcare professionals is advised for accurate
        diagnosis and treatment decisions.
